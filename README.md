# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! 

This is my first walkthrough project with the Code Institute on GitHub. 

The main focus of this project has been to gain an insight into how different files link together in a project and to reinforce the introductory HTML and CSS classes covered previously.
This project also led to an introduction to command line and working in a cloud based editor.

Although simple in its structure, this has been a formative experience as it allowed me to put the theory studied earlier into practice.
